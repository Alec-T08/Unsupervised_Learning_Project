Association Project:

The primary objective of this research was to uncover frequent itemsets combinations of products that are commonly purchased together by customers. 
Understanding these associations can provide valuable insights for businesses, such as designing effective product bundling strategies, optimizing store layouts, and improving marketing campaigns.
To analyze the dataset, two widely used algorithms for association rule mining were employed: Apriori and ECLAT. Both methods aim to identify frequent itemsets, but they differ in their approach.

Clustering Project:

The goal of this project is to identify natural groupings or clusters of wines based on key factors that influence consumer preferences, such as flavor profile, strength, and appearance. 
By performing clustering using important features, I aim to uncover distinct wine categories that could align with customer 
taste preferences or market segments, enabling a better understanding of the dataset structure.

Dimension Redduction Project:

The primary goal of the project is to reduce the datasetâ€™s high-dimensional feature space (28 features) to a lower-dimensional space for better visualization and analysis while preserving 
the underlying structure and separability of the two pistachio species: Kirmizi Pistachio and Siirt Pistachio. Since the dataset includes complex features related to shape, size, and color, 
dimension reduction will help reveal meaningful patterns, clusters, and potential separations between the pistachio types.
